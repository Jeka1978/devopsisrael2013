Session Title and Abstract
===
Moving Apps to the Cloud at a Massive Scale.

According to a recent survey 95% of enterprises are ready to move their
mission critical applications to the cloud in the next two years. At the
same time, only 5% has been successful in doing so. So far, cloud
migration processes have been done as one-off processes on a per
application basis. The challenge though, is how to move tens and
hundreds of apps â€“ including complex and legacy apps -- to the cloud in
only a few days. PaaS has the potential to deliver on this promise,
however most of the existing PaaS offerings only cater to new
applications that fit a certain language and stack. In this session, we
will learn about a new generation of PaaS and DevOps services that can
easily plug into your existing applications and move them to the Cloud
without any architectural or code changes.
